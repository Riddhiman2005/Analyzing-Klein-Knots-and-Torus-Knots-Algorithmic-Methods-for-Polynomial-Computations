# Analyzing-Klein-Knots-and-Torus-Knots-Algorithmic-Methods-for-Polynomial-Computations #


Through this paper, I tried exploring the intriguing relationship between **Klein knots** and **Torus knots** and tried to understand their mathematical connections. For this paper and repository, I wrote a Python algorithm that efficiently computes the bracket polynomial and the Jones polynomial of any Klein knot. The algorithm leverages the representation of Klein knots in the **Temperley-Lieb algebra**, providing us a unified framework for polynomial calculations. By employing this approach, the paper enables a deeper understanding of the intricate properties of Klein knots and their relationship to torus knots. The algorithmic methodology presented in the paper opens up new avenues for studying and analyzing these fascinating knot structures.
